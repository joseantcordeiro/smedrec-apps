# Audit Worker (`apps/audit`)

The Audit Worker (`audit-worker`) is a crucial backend component responsible for processing and storing audit log events. These events are generated by various services within the platform to track significant actions and changes.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Audit Worker is to:

- Consume audit log events from a centralized Redis queue.
- Process these events, mapping them to a structured format.
- Persist the processed audit logs into a PostgreSQL database for long-term storage, analysis, and compliance purposes.

This ensures that a comprehensive trail of activities is maintained across the system.

## Architecture

- **Event Source**: Services across the platform use the `@repo/audit` package to send audit events to a specific Redis queue.
- **Queueing System**: BullMQ, a robust Node.js library for message queues based on Redis, is used to manage the audit events.
- **Worker Process**: The `audit-worker` is a Node.js application that listens to this BullMQ queue.
- **Data Processing**: Upon receiving an event, the worker parses the data. It maps known event fields to dedicated columns in the `audit_log` database table. Any additional, service-specific properties are stored in a `details` JSONB column, allowing for flexibility in the audit data captured.
- **Database**: Processed audit events are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Drizzle ORM is used to interact with the database, managing schema and queries.
- **Logging**: The worker utilizes `workers-tagged-logger` for its operational logging, configurable via environment variables.
- **Error Handling**: BullMQ's built-in mechanisms handle job retries in case of processing failures.

## Data Model

The core data is stored in an `audit_log` table (defined in `apps/audit/src/db/schema.ts`). Key fields typically include:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the audit log entry.
- `timestamp`: Time of the event.
- `actor`: Information about the user or system component that performed the action.
- `action`: The type of action performed (e.g., `USER_LOGIN`, `PATIENT_RECORD_VIEWED`, `DATA_EXPORTED`).
- `target`: Information about the entity or resource that was affected by the action.
- `outcome`: Result of the action (e.g., `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`).
- `details`: A JSONB column to store any other relevant information specific to the event.

## Configuration

The worker is configured primarily through environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database.
- `REDIS_URL`: Connection string for the Redis instance.
- `AUDIT_QUEUE_NAME`: Name of the BullMQ queue to monitor (default: `audit`).
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Specifies the logging verbosity (e.g., `info`, `debug`).
- `WORKER_CONCURRENCY`: Defines how many jobs the worker can process concurrently.

## How it Works

1.  **Connection**: The worker establishes connections to Redis (for the queue) and PostgreSQL (for data storage).
2.  **Listening**: It actively listens to the designated BullMQ queue for incoming jobs.
3.  **Job Consumption**: When a new job (representing an `AuditLogEvent`) is picked up:
    a. The event data is parsed and validated.
    b. The data is mapped to the `audit_log` schema.
    c. The record is inserted into the PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.
4.  **Acknowledgement**: Upon successful insertion, the job is marked as complete in the queue. If an error occurs, BullMQ's retry strategy is invoked.

## Importance for the Platform

The Audit Worker plays a vital role in:

- **Security Monitoring**: Detecting suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements for data access and modification tracking (e.g., HIPAA).
- **Debugging and Troubleshooting**: Providing a historical record of actions that can help diagnose issues.
- **Analytics**: Offering insights into system usage patterns.

For details on setting up and running the worker locally, refer to its own `README.md` in `apps/audit/README.md`. The primary focus here is its role and architecture within the overall system.
